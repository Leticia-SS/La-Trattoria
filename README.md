# Italian Restaurant Website

This project is a university assignment designed to create a website for a fictional Italian restaurant. The restaurant does not exist, and the names, logos, and branding used within this project are purely for educational purposes.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The homepage of the restaurant website.
- **cardapio.html**: The page displaying the restaurant's menu.
- **reservas.html**: The reservations page for booking a table at the restaurant.
- **menucardapio.pdf**: A PDF version of the restaurant's menu.
- **style.css**: The main CSS file used for styling the website.
- **script.js**: JavaScript file containing interactive elements and functionality.
- **DroidSerif-Regular.ttf**: Font file used in the project.
- **GreatVibes-Regular.ttf**: Font file used in the project.
- **imagens/**: Directory containing images used on the website.
- **.github/workflows/jekyll-docker.yml**: GitHub Actions workflow file for deploying the project.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices.
- **Interactive Menu**: The menu page features a downloadable PDF for easy access to the restaurant's offerings.
- **Reservation System**: A simple reservation form allows users to book tables online.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser to view the website.
3. Navigate through the various pages (`cardapio.html`, `reservas.html`) to explore the restaurant's offerings.
